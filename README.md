# My-first-website

My first website - A local website written with HTML, CSS and JavaScript

Hi there.

To run the website: download the folder and just double click the index.html file.

My javascript includes:

- handling the navigation bar: if screen size is too small nav bar turns to a button at the top right.

- submitting the form with input validation:

    - Requiring all fields to have some value before submitting
    
    - Requiring a valid e-mail address
    
- form: opening user's default mail app with a pre-prepared mail that includes my mail in the "To" field and name and description in the mail's subject and body.
